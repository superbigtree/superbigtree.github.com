## Learn.js
### A guidebook to building projects with javascript.

This book should feel like a collection of LEGO guides, like walkthroughs for levels of a video game that gradually increase in difficulty, building on what you learned in previous levels.

The first few chapters of the book will be used as the curriculum for upcoming [Code Tutor workshops](http://codetutor.org), which are introductory javascript courses held in Seattle, WA.

### How to use this book
You should complete the first few chapters in order. There you'll learn js basics and how to use development tools. After that, you should work on whichever projects interest you most, in the order you choose.

This book is under active development. Learning to build a project with a certain javascript library is only useful for as long as that library is supported and the best solution to the problem. The tools we use for web development change regularly, and this book will morph along with the standards of the day.
