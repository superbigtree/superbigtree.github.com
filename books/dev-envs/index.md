## Why write this?
When I first started programming, learning the languages was the easy part compared to figuring out text editors, version control, testing, and all the different tools that come along with writing code for a real project.

My goal is for this book to help flatten the learning curve a little, so that going from hello world to a working on a complex application isn't quite as difficult for you as it was for me when I started out.

## About the book
If you're not sure how to choose between programming in ruby, python, or javascript, this guide will get you familiar with the tools, syntax, and workflow associated with each language.

By comparing ruby, python, and javascript development environments you'll get a strong sense of which language best fits your style. 

Maybe you'll learn that you want to work in all three, or two out of three. Whatever happens, you'll be able to use this guide as a reference if you need help remembering how to set up a development environment for any one of these three languages.

### Main concepts you'll learn:
- command-line tools
- virtual machines
- text editors
- version control
- package managers
- documentation
- testing
- language basics
- intro to web frameworks
