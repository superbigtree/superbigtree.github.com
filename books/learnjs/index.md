## Learn.js
### A guidebook to building projects with javascript.

**You know the basics of javascript, but the development tools and design patterns are what slow you down.**

Learn javascript tools & patterns through example projects.

Learn tools like npm, browserify, grunt, bower, yeoman, and the Chrome Dev Tools, along with common design patterns, creating and integrating content APIs, testing, and animation.

The book is currently in-progress, so if you pre-order it now you get all updates for free and can help guide the development of the book by suggesting topics.

### Goals of the book
You'll learn:  
- Javascript syntax, functions, data types, and programming patterns.
- How to find and use Javascript libraries.
- Using javascript/jquery to manipulate html elements.
- Using javascript for server-side coding.
- Using developer tools like Git, GitHub, Chrome Dev Tools, Bower, npm, and Grunt.
- How to build a wide range of projects with javascript, from the server to the client, from game development to data visualizations.


### How to use this book
You should complete the first few chapters in order. There you'll learn js basics and how to use development tools. After that, you should work on whichever projects interest you most, in the order you choose.

This book is under active development. Learning to build a project with a certain javascript library is only useful for as long as that library is supported and the best solution to the problem. The tools we use for web development change regularly, and this book will morph along with the standards of the day.
